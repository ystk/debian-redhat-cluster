# mkfs for GFS2 filesystem
#

To install:

 1. Edit the Makefile to point at your local copy of the kernel source
with GFS2 included in it, for my set up that means:

INCLUDEPATH=-I/home/steve/linux-2.6/include/

 2. make
 3. make install


You can then use it just like other mkfs programs (for example):

/sbin/mkfs -t gfs2 -j 1 -p lock_nolock /dev/sdb1

This will create a filesystem with one journal (i.e. mountable by a
maximum of one node at a time) with the nolock module (single node
use only) on /dev/sdb1. Running mkfs -f gfs2 -h will produce help
information.
