/*
 *  Per-buffer data
 *  One of these is attached as GFS private data to each FS block's buffer_head.
 *  These keep track of a buffer's progress through the transaction pipeline,
 *    using the "new" embedded log element to attach it to a being-built
 *    transaction, and moving the attachment point to the "incore" LE once
 *    the transaction completes (at which time the buffer becomes a candidate
 *    to be written to the on-disk log).
 *  A buffer may be attached simultaneously to a new and an incore transaction,
 *    but no more than one of each:  Only one new trans may be built at a time
 *    for a given buffer, obviously, since the buffer's contents are protected
 *    by an EXclusive glock when writing.  And, when a transaction is completely
 *    built, GFS combines incore transactions that share glocks (see
 *    incore_commit()), i.e. the glock that protects the buffer, so a buffer
 *    never needs to be attached to more than one (combined) incore trans.
 *  Note that multiple transactions can modify the buffer since its most
 *    recent writes to disk.  This principle applies to both in-place and
 *    journal block locations on-disk, allowing this node to keep modifying the
 *    cached data without writing it to disk, unless/until another node needs
 *    to access the data, or the Linux OS tells us to sync to disk.
 *  If a transaction follows another transaction before the first transaction's
 *    log completes (indicated by the in-place buffer head still being pinned
 *    in RAM), GFS copies the first transaction's results to a "frozen"
 *    image of the buffer, so the first transaction results (an atomic
 *    snapshot) can be logged properly, while the second transaction is
 *    modifying the "real" buffer.  This frozen copy lives only until the new
 *    transaction is complete, at which point one of two things has occurred:
 *    1).  Buffer was logged successfully; frozen copy's job is done.
 *    2).  Buffer was not yet logged; frozen copy no longer needed, newer
 *         buffer becomes the log candidate.
 *
 *  gfs_bufdata structs also link into the Active Items Lists (AIL) (buffers
 *    flushed to on-disk log, but not yet flushed to on-disk in-place locations)
 *    attached to:
 *    1).  The latest transaction to modify and log (on-disk) the buffer, and
 *    2).  The glock that protects the buffer's contents.
 *  The buffer is attached to only the most recent transaction's AIL
 *    list for a couple of reasons.  One is that only the most up-to-date
 *    buffer content needs to be written to the in-place block on-disk.  The
 *    other is that since there is a more recent copy of the block in
 *    the log, we don't need to keep the older copies in the log.  We can
 *    remove them from the AIL and let the log space be reused for new
 *    transactions (GFS advances the log tail when removing buffers from AIL).

 *      GL_EXACT:     Grant only if glock state is exactly the requested state.
 *      GL_LOCAL_EXCL:  Grant only one holder at a time within this node.
 *    With no flags, a hold will be granted to a SHARED request even if the
 *    node holds the glock in EXCLUSIVE mode.  See relaxed_state_ok().
 *  When a process needs to manipulate a lock, it requests it via one of

 *    3) waiters3, for promoting (locking a new glock, or changing a glock state
 *       to be more restrictive).

/*
 *  Glock Structure
 *  One for each inter-node lock held by this node.
 *  A glock is a local representation/abstraction of an inter-node lock.
 *    Inter-node locks are managed by a "lock module" (LM) which plugs in to
 *    the lock harness / glock interface (see gfs-kernel/harness).  Different
 *    lock modules support different lock protocols (e.g. GULM, GDLM, no_lock).
 *  A glock may have one or more holders within a node.  See gfs_holder above.
 *  Glocks are managed within a hash table hosted by the in-core superblock.
 *  After all holders have released a glock, it will stay in the hash table
 *    cache for a time (depending on lock type), during which the inter-node
 *    lock will not be released unless another node needs the lock (lock
 *    manager requests this via callback to GFS through LM on this node).  This
 *    provides better performance in case this node needs the glock again soon.
 *    See comments for meta_go_demote_ok(), glops.c.
 *  Each glock has an associated vector of lock-type-specific "glops" functions
 *    which are called at important times during the life of a glock, and
 *    which define the type of lock (e.g. dinode, rgrp, non-disk, etc).
 *    See gfs_glock_operations above.
 *  A glock, at inter-node scope, is identified by the following dimensions:
 *    1)  lock number (usually a block # for on-disk protected entities,
 *           or a fixed assigned number for non-disk locks, e.g. MOUNT).
 *    2)  lock type (actually, the type of entity protected by the lock).
 *    3)  lock namespace, to support multiple GFS filesystems simultaneously.
 *           Namespace (usually cluster:filesystem) is specified when mounting.
 *           See man page for gfs_mount.
 *  Glocks require support of Lock Value Blocks (LVBs) by the inter-node lock
 *    manager.  LVBs are small (32-byte) chunks of data associated with a given
 *    lock, that can be quickly shared between cluster nodes.  Used for certain
 *    purposes such as sharing an rgroup's block usage statistics without
 *    requiring the overhead of:
 *      -- sync-to-disk by one node, then a
 *      -- read from disk by another node.
