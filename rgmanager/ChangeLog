	not need to be fenced as a result of rgmanager crashing.  Add protos
	for memb_set_state and member_online functions.
	* include/reslist.h: Fix type error; node IDs are 32-bit ints, not 
	64-bit ints.
	* src/clulib/members.c: Add member_set_state/online functions for
	quick checks and sets of the protected member list.  Zero out
	the node structure prior to calling cman_get_nodeid so that we 
	don't get ENOENT (fixed clustat bug where clustat didn't report
	the "local" flag).  Fix node ID type.

	decide if we need to wait for a node to be fenced or not.  Fix
	node ID type.

	Invalidate local VF cache and kill resource configurations on
	loss of quorum (#202497).  Send RG_EQUORUM back to clustat/clusvcadm
	so that they report why they can't get information.  Don't queue
	status checks if we've lost quorum.  Add command line parameter to
	disable internal crash watchdog

2006-08-21 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/daemons/main.c: Fix #202500 - simultaneous starts confuse
	rgmanager.  This happened due to the fact that rgmanager was not
	correctly determining port listening status of other nodes on the
	first pass, and subsequent attempts to determine status of other 
	nodes were not tried.

2006-08-18 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/resgroup.h: Change ordering and add magic field to
	rgmanager state field (warning: breaks compatibility from 08/08 CVS!)

	warning messages if status check fails
	* src/resources/ra-api-1-modified.dtd: Allow 'migrate' option

	that they're LOG_NOTICE, and only one default is used (#200776)

2006-08-08 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/clulib/members.c: Fix gained/lost list creation so that the
	count is actually nonzero (#201713)
	* src/daemons/main.c: Fix typo in debug information.  Kill CMAN handle
	before doing a member list update.  Don't call memb_online; just

	until the node actually closes port (#201713).
	* src/utils/clusvcadm.c: Fix relocation issues (#201711).

2006-08-07 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/clulib/ckpt_state.c: Preliminary implementation of replacement

	cman_handle_t, which is void*, should be using void ** all over)
	* include/message.h: Bump context count to 128, add destination
	node ID in header of packets.
	* src/clulib/alloc.c: If we alloc the same size, return the same
	block

	* src/clulib/message.c: Add error checking to msg_print
	* src/clulib/msg_cluster.c: Check destination in header before 
        processing message remove dup #define for MAX_CONTEXTS, add
	proto_error() macro for displaying protocol errors.  Use 'max' 
	instead of 'fd' for select().  Use correct var when assigning
	contexts.  Fix CMAN handles.  Return correct size from msg_send()
	requests.
	* src/clulib/msgtest.c: Fix CMAN handles
	* src/clulib/vft.c: Don't handle VF_CURRENT inside comms thread
	* src/daemons/main.c: Check to see if nodes are listening on our
	port before we consider them running.  Handle VF_CURRENT requests
	from other nodes.  Fail if we can't determine local node ID
	* src/daemons/rg_forward.c: Give 10 minutes for responses to
	forwarded requests.
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Shorten RG state names.  Fix 'Uncertain'
	output line.

	CVS head (fixes #193247)
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Add debug messages.  Actually count

2006-05-16 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/resources/nfsclient.sh: Fix 189218 - nfsclient not matching
	wildcards correctly when checking status.  Allow disabling of
	recovery for services where the nfs clients are ordered (this will
	cause a full service restart, but works)
	* src/resources/clusterfs.sh, fs.sh, svclib_nfslock, service.sh:
	Implement rudimentary atomic bomb-style NFS lock reclaim handling
	Needs compatible and correctly configured version of nfs-utils 
	installed and running on the system.  For clusterfs.sh, ensure
	that we flush buffers during service tear-down - regardless of
	whether or not we unmount the file system.
	* src/utils/clunfslock.sh: HA-callout program (/usr/sbin/clunfslock)
	for use with the rpc.statd -H parameter.  Copies the client to all
	cluster-managed mounted file systems so that it will get lock
	reclaim notification on failover.

2006-05-09 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/list.h: Prevent dereferencing curr if it's null for some

	* src/clulib/vft.c: Add local reads for fast clustat operation.
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Count all resource groups for all nodes 
	in one pass, rather than one node per pass.  Split queueing of
	status checks off so we never block the main thread.  Mark services
	which have autostart=0 in the config as "disabled" to help remove
	confusion between "disabled", "stopped", and the no-longer-needed
	"stopped but behave like disabled" states. bz #182454 /
	#190234 / #190408	
	* src/daemons/fo_domain.c: Add patch from Josef Whiter to 
	implement no-failback option for a given FO domain - bz #189841
	* src/daemons/main.c: Queue node events for another thread to
	handle, so we never block the main thread.  Also, implement 
	cluster-wide service lock/unlock feature from clumanager 1.2.x
	- bz #175010
	* src/daemons/nodeevent.c: Split out node event queueing / handling
	in to a separate thread so the main thread does not block
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Return error codes if resource groups
	are locked.
	* src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Fix assertion failure causing segfault
	in extremely rare cases.  Quash the rg queue during shutdown.
	- bz #181539
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Add fast local service state query to
	reduce unnecessary lock contention
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Handle request for expedited information
	from clustat.
	* src/daemons/main.c: Pass arg1 to send_rg_states() to enable fast
	clustat operation.
	* src/resources/fs.sh: Implement user/group quota support if 
	enabled in the file system options
	* src/utils/clustat.c: Misc. error handling.  Add single service / 
	member output and add -Q to the help information.  #185952.
	Added -f flag.
	* src/utils/clusvcadm.c: Implement client-side of #175010
	* src/utils/clustat.c: show transition time in clustat -x
	- bz #191398
	* src/resources/fs.sh: enable user/group quotas if enabled in the
	options attribute - bz #191182
	* init.d/rgmanager: fix typo - bz #191205


-------------

2005-03-21 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* init.d/rgmanager, Makefile: Fix up init script and add Makefile
	so that the init script is properly installed #142754
	* src/daemons/*: Fixes for #150344, #151187: Relocate to same node
	returns failure, hang during shutdown if user relocate is in-flight.
	Fix service state getting stuck in "recoverable" on fail-to-start
	scenarios where other nodes failed (or no other node was available)
	Rename "resourcegroup" to "service" to be consistent with UI
	* src/resources/fs.sh, clusterfs.sh: Fix #151077: Force unmount broken
	* src/resources/netfs.sh: Fix #151091: netfs status broken
	* src/resources/resourcegroup.sh, service.sh: Remove resourcegroup,
	rename to service.sh

2005-03-14 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/resources/clusterfs.sh, fs.sh: Make clusterfs actually work.
	Clean up fs.sh + clusterfs.sh "status" when mount reports none/
	devpets/usbdev/etc.
	* src/daemons/test.c: Add a 'rules' test function for printing
	resource rules to stdout.
	* src/daemons/reslist.c: Fix 151095

2005-03-07 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/resgroup.h: Add STOP_USER so we can handle user 
	STOP (instead of just DISABLE) requests.  #150333
	* src/resources/fs.sh: umount should umount mount points, not
	devices.  Handle symlinks to file system block devices.  #150481
	* src/clulib/rg_strings.c: Add user stop string.
	* src/clulib/gettid.c: errno fix from trunk
	* src/clulib/vft.c: Connect timeout extension for VF
	* src/daemons/main.c: Separate connect + login.  GuLM doesn't know
	about SGs.
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Change stop handling.  Add generic recover
	function.
	* src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Add support for RESTART, USER_STOP.
	#150330, #150333
	* src/utils/clusvcadm.c: Use USER_STOP to signal a user-called stop.
	#150333

2005-03-02 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/clulog.h: Change default log level to INFO
	* include/resgroup.h: Add proto for "best_target_node"
	* src/clulib/clulog.c: Change log facility to LOG_DAEMON to match
	other cluster daemons (e.g. lock_gulmd)
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Add best_target_node, count_resource_groups.
	Implement missing autostart-disable feature and requested exclusive
	resource group feature.  Store configuration view number so we can
	tell when the configuration changes.
	* src/daemons/main.c: Print node state transition messages before
	calling node_event().  Use do_status_checks() so we don't try to
	check services we're not running.  Bump periodic status event
	queueing to 10 seconds instead of 5.  Poll ccsd for config updates
	since we have no other way to find them.  Fix bug preventing
	status checks when clustat -i 1 is running.
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Fix handle_relocate_req so that it uses
	best_target_node() correctly.  Leave services which failed on all
	current nodes as 'stopped', so the next node transition will cause
	us to try to restart it automagically.  Consider recovery policy
	when taking recovery action.
	* src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Use recovery routine instead of start.
	* src/daemons/restree.c: Fix tree delta updates.
	* src/resources/resourcegroup.sh: Add 'exclusive' parameter.  Change
	'autostart' to a boolean instead of string.  Add recovery policy
	parameter.
	* src/utils/clusvcadm.c: Make "relocate to node X" work.

2005-02-28 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	*  errors.txt: Remove random whitespace at the bottom.
	* include/resgroup.h: Add do_status_checks proto
	* include/rg_queue.h: Remove __ definitions so as not to conflict
	with glibc internals.
	* include/vf.h: Increase VF_COORD_TIMEOUT to something reasonable.
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Add do_status_checks().  We were previously
	queueing status checks for RGs that we didn't own.  Not useful.
	* src/daemons/main.c: Fix for #149410.
	* src/daemons/rg_state.c: Fix various failover service problems.
	* src/resources/script.sh: Remove "recover" from generic script
	wrapper.

=======================================================================

2004-09-23 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/reslist.h: Add needstart/needstop/common flags for
	reconfiguration.  Added RS_CONDSTART/CONDSTOP to perform "stop
	if needed/start if needed" operations after a resource [group]
	reconfiguration.  Cleaned up structures.  Added NO_CCS define for
	testing.
	* src/daemons/fo_domain.c: Added NO_CCS defines for testing.
	* src/daemons/main.c: Added reconfigure() stub function.  Added
	testing support.
	* src/daemons/reslist.c: Added comparsion + primary-attr functions
	for resources.  Add printout of needstart/stop in resource dump.
	* src/daemons/restree.c: Added resource list comparsion + 
	resource tree comparison functions.  Added condstart/stop to ops
	list.  Added CONDSTART/CONDSTOP handling in res_op.
	* src/daemons/rg_locks.c: Added NO_CCS support for testing.

2004-09-13 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* include/resgroup.h: Add a default check interval.
	* include/reslist.h: Add a recover operation, and put operations
	and checks together in each instantiated resource structure.
	* src/daemons/groups.c: Don't use the old rg_status() func --
	its internals have changed.
	* src/daemons/reslist.c: Duplicate the action structure of a 
	parent resource type into an instantiated resource.
	* src/daemons/resrules.c: Find the actions with the correct
	path.
	* src/daemons/restree.c: Add depth parameter to res_exec.  Add
	do_status - find the highest check/status level to perform given
	the elapsed time since another status operation was performed.
	Add a reference count each time a resource is started on a node.
	* src/daemons/rg_thread.c: Implement periodic status checks. 
 	Currently (in contrast to clumanager 1.2), these status checks
	are automatic and not configurable.
	* src/resources/*: Misc updates re: check intervals, new 
	parameters, etc.

2004-09-07 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/resources/group.sh: Add 'autostart' parameter to group 
	entity
	* src/daemons/*: Add support for OCF 'action' specifications.

2004-08-30 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* src/resources/*: Add status/monitor actions to metadata
	* include/list.h: Update to fix compiler warnings.  This is not
	complete; it's better to add a 'field' to structures requiring 
	list specs.
	* src/clulib/vft.c: Remove unnecessary pthread locks.
	* src/daemons/*: Misc. code cleanups.

2004-08-12 Lon Hohberger <lhh at redhat.com>
	* global: prepare for RPM build
