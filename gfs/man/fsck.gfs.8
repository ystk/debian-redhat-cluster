.SH NAME
fsck.gfs - Offline GFS file system checker

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsck.gfs
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIDEVICE\fR

.SH WARNING
All GFS nodes \fImust\fP have the GFS filesystem unmounted before running
fsck.gfs.  Failure to unmount all nodes may result in filesystem corruption.

.SH DESCRIPTION
fsck.gfs will check that the GFS file system on a device is structurally valid.
It should not be run on a mounted file system.  If file system corruption is
detected, it will attempt to repair the file system.  There is a limit to what
fsck.gfs can do.  If important file system structures are destroyed, such that
the checker can not determine what the repairs should be, reparations could
fail.

GFS is a journaled file system, and as such should be able to repair damages to
the file system on its own.  However, faulty hardware has the ability to write
incomplete blocks to a file system thereby causing corruption that GFS can not
fix.  The first step to ensuring a healthy file system is the selection of
reliable hardware (i.e. storage systems that will write complete blocks - even
in the event of power failure).
