High Priority / Blockers:

* Nothing at this time.

Medium Priority:

* Need to add ability for fence_xvmd to forcefully fence the host
dom0 if it's not responding.  Medium because it should not be the
default behavior since fencing a host can affect multiple domains
across potentially multiple domU clusters.  This will be a server-
side configuration option; domUs will not be able to override it.

* Support multiple authentication keys in fence_xvmd simultaneously
so that we can fence multiple clusters with only one instance of
fence_xvmd running on a given dom0.

Low Priority:

* Turn README in to man pages.

* Make sure CMAN is running and/or restart/reconnect if CMAN goes
away and comes back.  (If CMAN dies, we have big problems anyway)

* Add SSL connection support.  (Challenge/response on a trusted
network should be okay.)

* Make sure addresses contained in the multicast packet are always
in network-byte order.  Low because it will be unlikely that the
host-byte ordering of a domU and its dom0 will be different.

* Make sure node IDs and VM states stored in openais checkpoints
are in network-byte order and swap back/forth if not.
