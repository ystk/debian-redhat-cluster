.TH fence_xcat 8

.SH NAME
fence_xcat - I/O Fencing agent for xcat environments

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_xcat
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_xcat is a wrapper to the rpower(1) command that is distributed
with the xCAT project available at http://www.xcat.org.  Use of 
fence_xcat requires that xcat has already been properly configured
for your environment.  Refer to xCAT(1) for more information on 
configuring xCAT.

fence_xcat accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.
fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_xcat 
can be run by itself with command line options which is useful for testing.

NOTE: It is recommended that fence_bladecenter(8) is used instead of fence_xcat if
the bladecenter firmware supports telnet.  This interface is much cleaner and
easier to setup.
