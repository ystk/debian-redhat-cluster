.SH NAME
fence_drac - fencing agent for Dell Remote Access Card 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 
fence_drac
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_drac is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the Dell Remote
Access Card (DRAC).  This card provides remote access to controlling 
power to a server.  It logs into the DRAC through the telnet interface of
the card.  By default, the telnet interface is not enabled.  To enable the
interface, you will need to use the racadm command in the racser-devel rpm 
available from Dell.  To enable telnet on the DRAC:

[root]# racadm config -g cfgSerial -o cfgSerialTelnetEnable 1

[root]# racadm racreset

fence_drac accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_drac 
can be run by itself with command line options.  This is useful for testing 
and for turning outlets on or off from scripts.
