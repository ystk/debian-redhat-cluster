.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_zvm
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_zvm is an I/O Fencing agent used on a GFS virtual machine in a s390 or zSeries VM cluster.
It uses the s3270 program to log the specified virtual machine out of VM.
For fence_zvm to execute correctly, you must have s3270 in your PATH.

fence_zvm accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.
fence_node sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.
fence_zvm can be run by itself with command line options which is useful
for testing.
