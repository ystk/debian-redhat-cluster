.SH NAME
fence_rsb - I/O Fencing agent for Fujitsu-Siemens RSB

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B 
fence_rsb
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_rsb is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the Fujitsu-Siemens
RSB management interface.  It logs into an RSB device via telnet and reboots
the associated machine. Lengthy telnet connections to the RSB device 
should be avoided while a GFS cluster is running because the connection 
will block any necessary fencing actions.

fence_rsb accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_rsb
can be run by itself with command line options.  This is useful for testing.
