.SH NAME
fence_egenera - I/O Fencing agent for the Egenera BladeFrame

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_egenera
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_egenera is an I/O Fencing agent which can be used with the Egenera
BladeFrame.  It logs into a control blade (cserver) via ssh and operates
on a processing blade (pserver) identified by the pserver name and the 
logical process area network (LPAN) that it is in.  fence_egenera requires
that ssh keys have been setup so that the fence_egenera does not require
a password to authenticate.  Refer to ssh(8) for more information on setting
up ssh keys.

fence_egenera accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.  
Fenced sends parameters through stdin when it execs the agent.  fence_egenera 
can also be run by itself with command line options.
